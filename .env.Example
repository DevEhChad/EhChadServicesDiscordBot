# - After filling in the values above, copy this file to `.env` in the project root (the real `.env` is ignored by git).
# - Some commands/tools may expect the token variable named DISCORD_TOKEN instead of TOKEN. If you use any
#   external scripts that expect DISCORD_TOKEN, either set DISCORD_TOKEN in your environment or add it to the .env:
# DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
